🚗 Car Price Prediction using Deep Learning

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a neural network with TensorFlow and Keras to predict car prices based on multiple features. The workflow covers data preparation, model development, training, visualization, evaluation, and validation.

📌 Features

✔️ Data preparation & preprocessing

✔️ Train-validation-test data split

✔️ Building neural networks with TensorFlow & Keras

✔️ Model compilation with optimizers, loss functions, and metrics

✔️ Training & visualizing learning curves

✔️ Model evaluation on validation & test sets

✔️ Understanding overfitting and underfitting behavior

🛠 Tech Stack & Libraries

Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Evaluation: Scikit-learn (metrics, train-test split)

📊 Project Workflow

1. Data Preparation

Load dataset (CSV file with car attributes like mileage, year, horsepower, brand, etc.)

Handle missing values, categorical encoding, and normalization

Perform train-validation-test split

2. Model Building

Define neural network layers (Dense layers with activation functions)

Compile the model with:

Optimizer: Adam/SGD

Loss: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Metrics: MAE / RMSE

3. Model Training

Train with prepared data

Use callbacks like EarlyStopping & ModelCheckpoint

Track performance during epochs

4. Visualization

Plot training vs validation loss and metrics

Visualize predictions vs actual car prices

5. Model Evaluation

Evaluate on validation data

Final testing on unseen data

Report metrics: MAE, RMSE, R² score
